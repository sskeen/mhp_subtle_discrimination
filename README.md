# Linguistic markers of subtle discrimination among mental health professionals

***Description:***[^1] Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD), African American, and Hispanic people endure disparities in psychiatric morbidity and discrimination in mental healthcare access. Initial clinical encounters, including appointment queries to private practice mental health professionals (MHPs), represent an under-examined context in which subtle discrimination may deter prospective clients. Previous experimental audit studies examine discrimination in healthcare access by quantifying _if_ the MHP responds to appointment queries. We consider _how_ the MHP responds, examining whether subtle discrimination could occur through response quality rather than response rates, exclusively. We used email and voicemail transcription data from a pilot audit study of MHP responses to appointment queries by simulated prospective clients, identical in presentation, but varied by race, ethnicity, and disclosed TGD status.[^2] Applying hybrid qualitativeâ€“AI language modeling techniques to these data, we conceptualized markers of MHP response quality capable of accurate classification by discriminative pretrained language models.
